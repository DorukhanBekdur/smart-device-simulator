# Smart Device Simulator

A simple terminal-based smart home device simulator built with C++.

This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming principles such as classes, encapsulation, and polymorphism. It simulates control over smart devices like a Smart TV, Air Conditioner, and Washing Machine through a simple command-line interface.

## Features

- List smart devices
- Turn devices ON and OFF
- Show device status (ON/OFF)
- Terminal-based interaction

## Technologies Used

- C++11
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Command-line interface

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DorukhanBekdur/smart-device-simulator.git
   cd smart-device-simulator
   ```
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp SmartDevice.cpp -0 smart && ./smart
   ```
3. Follow the menu instructions in the terminal
   ```bash
   ===== Smart Device Control Panel =====
    1. List Devices
    2. Turn On a Device
    3. Turn Off a Device
    4. Show Device Status
    0. Exit

    Your choice: 
    ```
